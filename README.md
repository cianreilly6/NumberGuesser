Building the Number Guessing Game was a fun project where I learned how to combine basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and error handling.
I used Pythonâ€™s random module to generate a random number and created a feedback system to tell the player if their guess was "too high" or "too low." 
One of the challenges was ensuring the game handled invalid inputs properly, which taught me a lot about user input validation. 
Overall, it was a simple yet satisfying project that helped me practice my Python skills while creating an interactive and enjoyable game
